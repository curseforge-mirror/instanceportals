Instance Portals
=============

Work-in-progress AddOn for World of Warcraft that displays dungeon & raid instance portal locations on the world map & zone maps (similar to WoW: Legion).

Clicking a portal will take you to the Encounter Journal for that dungeon/raid.

Only tested with WoW v6.2.4.21463 but should work on other versions.
