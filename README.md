Instance Portals
=============

Work-in-progress AddOn for World of Warcraft that displays dungeon & raid instance portal locations on the world map & zone maps (similar to WoW: Legion).

Clicking a portal will take you to the Encounter Journal for that dungeon/raid.

Built & tested with WoW 8.0.1.
